## 🧩 Schematic  
The XOR gate is implemented using complementary CMOS logic and verified using a testbench.

---

## 🧪 Testbench  
The testbench applies all logic input combinations to the XOR gate to verify its truth table.

---

## 📈 Transient Simulation  
The waveform confirms the XOR gate’s functionality: output is high only when inputs differ.

---

## 🧱 Layout  
The physical layout is drawn using standard cells and transistors, conforming to 90nm design rules.

## ✅ DRC and LVS Checks  

### ✔️ DRC: Design Rule Check  
No design rule violations; layout is clean and fabrication-compliant.
