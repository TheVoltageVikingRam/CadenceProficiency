## Schematic  
The AND gate is implemented using CMOS logic with pull-up PMOS and pull-down NMOS networks.

## Testbench  
The testbench is used to provide input stimulus and observe output response.

## DRC and LVS Checks

- ✅ **No DRC Errors:**  
  Verified using DRC tool — no design rule violations.

- ✅ **LVS Clean:**  
  The layout matches the schematic with no mismatches.
