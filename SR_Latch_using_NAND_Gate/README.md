# SR Latch using NAND Gates (CMOS Design in Cadence Virtuoso)

This project showcases the design and implementation of an **SR (Set-Reset) Latch** using two cross-coupled **NAND gates**, created using Cadence Virtuoso. It includes all necessary stages: schematic design, symbol generation, testbench simulation, layout creation, verification (DRC/LVS), RC parasitic extraction, and energy analysis.

## üîß Schematic

The latch is implemented using two 2-input NAND gates connected in a cross-coupled manner. Inputs are **S (Set)** and **R (Reset)**.

## üß© Symbol View

A clean symbol was generated to allow hierarchical design usage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Testbench

A testbench was created to verify the latch behavior across various S and R input combinations.

## üìà Transient Response

The transient simulation confirms correct operation:
- Q is set when S = 0, R = 1
- Q is reset when S = 1, R = 0
- Invalid state at S = 0, R = 0

## üß± Layout

The layout of the SR latch was drawn following GPDK 90nm design rules.
