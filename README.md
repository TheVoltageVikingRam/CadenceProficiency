# Cadence Proficiency

This repository demonstrates my proficiency in Cadence EDA tools through a curated set of snapshots taken from various analog and digital design projects. Each project reflects different stages of VLSI design using Cadence Virtuoso, including schematics, layouts, DRC/LVS/PEX outputs, and extracted views.

### 🔒 Access to Original CAD Files

> ⚠️ **Note**: This repository only contains **PNG snapshots** of the actual designs.  
> The original Cadence Virtuoso project files (schematic, layout, netlist, simulation setup) are securely maintained in a **private repository**.

If you are a recruiter, hiring manager, or collaborator and wish to review the **source CAD files** for any specific project:

- Kindly send a request via:  
  - 💼 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ram-tripathi-94365a257)  
  - Or open an issue with your contact details and purpose of access.

I will be happy to grant selective access on a case-by-case basis especially for recruiters.
